# Optimization problem solver

This project is an optimization problem solver, having an objective function as input and generating an optimized output using popular numerical methods.

## âš¡ Getting started

**NOTE: It is required to have a python version of 3.9 or greater installed.**

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to handle python packaging and dependency management. To install, please visit the [installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

To run:

`poetry run python app.py`

To test:

`poetry run python pytest`

However, unfortunately we didn't manage to implement any good tests either (because lack of time)...

### Documentation

This project was supposed to use `mkdocs` to generate documentation, but because of lack of time did not manage in time..
